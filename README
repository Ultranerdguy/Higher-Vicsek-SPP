Simulates a collection of particles in a periodic space interacting according
to the Vicsek model of Self Propelled Particles.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicsek_model

The simulation starts with a random factor of 10 radians, and slowly reduces
this to 0. It records how the particles interact into a file called
"anvData##.csv" where ## indicates the dimension currently being tested.

The data output to "anvData##.csv" is a measure of how aligned the particles are
and varies from 0 to 1, where 0 is all particles facing different directions,
and 1 is all particles facing the same direction.

The simulation will start in 2D, and slowing increment the dimensionality,
though modifications can be made to only simulate a single dimension. A new
"anvData" file is made each time it increments.

If you run the program, the files generated will be in the format
Random Factor, Average anv
And will be ordered in decreasing 'Random Factor'
E.g. a sample from anvData4.csv

1.00, 0.097223
0.99, 0.237802
0.98, 0.191710
0.97, 0.162164
0.96, 0.268714

While the output is noisy, the general relationship shows the average anv to
decrease as the random factor increases.
